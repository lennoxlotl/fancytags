# Fancy Tags

Fancy Tags is a LabyMod Addon which uses [Mixins](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/) to inject into minecraft to change
the font of the minecraft entity labels to a custom font.

## Installation

There is no real installation tutorial yet as the mod is unfinished, if you are a developer you know how to compile and use it.
##### BEWARE: You need to be careful with the mappings when using forge!

## Development Setup
